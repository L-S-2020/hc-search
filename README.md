# hc-search
A semantic search engine for hack club information.

## Features
- Search on the websites, GitHub repos and Slack.
- automatic crawler and embedding system
- clean Slack UI to find information

## How to use it?
Just invite @hc-search to a channel and run /hc-search 'term' to search in the vector database.

## Why did I build it?
 I build hc-search because the information about hack club and the belonging projects are very wide spread, so finding the right peace of information is sometimes really time-consuming.
## Underlining technology
- Python
- Slack SDK
- Chroma DB
- Github API
- Selenium
